# Maggie's ArcGIS Portfolio 

Welcome to my portfolio page for Advanced GIS at Carnegie Mellon University

## About Me
My name is Maggie Harger, and I am a second year student earning my Master's of Science in Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University. Before coming here I worked in the greater Seattle area helping underserved communities acquire greater access to mobility services by working with public transit agencies. In addition to graduate school, I currently work part time for the US Department of Transportation as a Policy Analyst intern. In my free time you might see me running, eating good food, or biking around Pittsburgh.


## What I Hope to Learn...
By taking this course, I hope to learn how to better manipulate ArcGIS to understand patterns in spatial data. I would also like to practice the GIS skills that I currently have, since I have been using them for my Capstone project. It would also be interesting to learn more about ArcGIS dashboards.

When I graduate, I plan to get a job working directly in governments or with governments as a consultant. I would like to specifically focus on policy related to transportation and city planning.
