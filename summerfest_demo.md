# Map demo of ArcGIS ExperienceBuilder App

Below is a demonstration of the web-based application in ArcGIS that allows users to see ineractive GIS maps on their web browser. To create this map I first made a custom basemap that had a color scheme related to Pittsburgh--shades of black, brown and yellow. After that, I symbolized the locations of the SummerFest venues with an image of a beer mug. This allows participants to quickly see where the closest venue would be. In future, information about the venue, such as address or other aspects of the site could be added.
