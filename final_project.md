# Final Project: Analysis of Bridge Infrastructure in Pennsylvania

American infrastructure is aging rapidly, especially bridges. In order to maintain and upkeep these structures, states must be sure to successfully track the conditions of their bridges. Additionally, it is important for jurisdictions within states to be aware of funding sources to repair these bridges, especially new revenue streams from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In total, Pennsylvania has 713 bridges older than 50 years old and rated as being in poor condition. The full dataset of bridge with condition information can be found [here](https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=35)

The following ArcGIS insights page will help people involved with bridge repair across the state understand areas in the state with high need across a variety of categories.

Once a bridge has been identified as in high need of funding for repairs, then an applicable funding source should be identified. THe state of Pennsylvania generally has limited funds due to a variety of factors. For one, the sheer number of aging bridges in the state makes it difficult to keep up with maintenance and repairs. Additionally, fund sources such as tolls have been fought by local municipalities, making them difficult to implement. 

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) has proposed a [variety of ways](https://www.penndot.pa.gov/about-us/funding/solutions/Pages/default.aspx) to supplement fund sources, including tolls, mileage based user fees, congestion pricing, corridor tolling and additonal fees ant taxes.

In addition to proposed funding sources, there are a number of current sources, both federal and state-specific that interested parties can utilize.
