### Reflection 

The above assignment on the supply and purchasing of pain medication across the United States was completed using ArcGIS Insights. Since this was my first time working with ArcGIS Insights, I found the instructions about various ways to visualize the data helpful. Importing the data to the platform was easy, especially because I have worked with similar platforms such as Tableau in the past. Additionally, geocoding the location data was very user friendly. I think this was one of the best things about using Insights, because having geocoded before using ArcGIS Pro the process can sometimes be tedious. Insignts made it very straightforward. Though, I imagine if some points were not accurately geocoded, it may be somewhat difficult to discover this. 

I also learned about various ways to visualize data by completing this assignment. In this example, a supplier was linked to a buyer, and visualized as nodes with arrow-shaped arcs in between. This helped me to understand what regions of the United States were supplying Mingo County with pain pills, as well as the magnitude of the supply, since the arcs could be weighted based on dosage unit. I do think the visualization needs a bit of explanation to understand quickly, so in that sense it might be good to alter it slightly, but overall it is very nice and something that could not be done in regular GIS.

I also completed a pitch deck that compares Pro to Insights.
